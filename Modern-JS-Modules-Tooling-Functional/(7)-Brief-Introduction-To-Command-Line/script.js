//! Before use of the tool like parcel we need learn a little bit about commanline
//! All the build tools that are available on NPM only work in the commandline

//! We can do it on a different windows. On Mac open terminal on windows open command prompt(cmd)
//! Since we use VS Code and it have an integrated terminal

//! First think is we are always in a folder

//! for Mac "ls" and for Windows "dir" will show us the contents

//! "cd" for change directory we can go up and down
//! ".." for go up

//! After that we can see the folders where we are at that moment
//! To move one of the folder just write cd and after type the folder or use "tab" key

//! When we want to move two level just use "cd ../.."

//! Write "clear" to clear console

//! To create a folder write "mkdir TEST" here TEST is folder name

//! To create file "touch" on Mac and "edit" on Windows can be used
//! We can create multiple files "touch index.html style.css script.js"

//! To delete file "rm" on Mac and "del" on Windows can be used

//! To move one of the file to parent folder use "mv index.js ../" first we write file second we write the place where we want to place it.

//! To delete folder "rmdir TEST" and if directory is not empty rmdir will not work
//! To delete folder on MAC we can use "rm -R TEST" here -R recursively delete all the file then delete directory
