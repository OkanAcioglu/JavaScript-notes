// * JAVASCRIPT is a HIGH LEVEL , OBJECT ORIENTED , MULTI PARADIGM programing language.
// * JS is a programming language that Ä±nstruct computer to do things and it in need of "compailer"
// * HIGH LEVEL means we don't have to worry about complex stuffs like "memory management"
// * OBJECT ORIENTED means based on "objects",for storing most kinds of data.
// * MULTI PARADIGM means we can use different styles of programming such as declarative and imperative programming.
// * JS comes from "server" with it's own codes so it is a "Frontend Programming Languages"
// * Nearly all web-sites consists JS codes

// !!! "Declarative programming" is a paradigm describing "WHAT" the program does, "without explicitly" specifying it's control flow.
// !!! "Imperative programming" is a paradigm describing "HOW" the program should do something "by explicitly" specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.

// !! ECMA SCRIPT , ES6 ,  (ES2015) -> Took huge update language ever.
// !! After 2015 that ES6 release until today -> JS called Modern JavaScript.

// * JS codes can be added to "header" section of "HTML" in "script" tag so called "internal JS" but it is always better to use "external JS" because of the same logic as "external CSS" has.
// * "External JS" always added end of the "HTML" page on top the closing "body" tag. Why? Because we want first render "HTML" and "CSS" codes then render "JS" codes.
