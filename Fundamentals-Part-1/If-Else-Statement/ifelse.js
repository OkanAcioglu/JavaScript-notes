// !!! Above code we define "century" outside the "block" first.

// ??? "50 <= number <= 400" let number = 40 -> We cannot use this as a "condition" if we want to "target" the "number" that in between "50 and 400". This usage gives us result like below which is completely wrong:
// 50 <= number=40 -> false
// false <= 400
// 0 <= 400 -> true

// ??? if(day === "saturday" || "sunday") -> case like the left side, according to precedence table, "first" JS will check whether "day" "strictli equal" to the "saturday" or not. Then check the "OR" case between "sunday" and result that coming from the other check. Independant of the "day", result will always "true"
