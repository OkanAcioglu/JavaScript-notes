// * "value" is "piece of data"
// ! "Jonas" -> is a "value"
// * In JS -> everythink is "value"
// * store "values" into "variable"
let firstName = 'Jonas' // ! "value" assigned a "variable" this process so called "declaring a variable"

// * Snake Case -> first_name
// * Kebab Case -> first-name
// * Camel Case -> firstName

// ? Variable Names:
//   ! Only contain "letters" , "numbers" , "dollar sign" and "underscores (_)"
//   ! No "number" at starting
//   ! No "space" between words.
//   ! No "reserved JS word" such as new , function , name...
//   ! No "turkish character" (Advice)
//   ! No "start with uppercase" (Advice)
//   ! Use "all uppercase names" for "values" that "never change" such as "PI=3.14"
