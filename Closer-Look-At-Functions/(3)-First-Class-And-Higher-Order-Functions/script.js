'use strict'

// * JS has first class functions. This is enable us to write higher order functions.
//!  -------------- FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS -----------
//? JS treats functions as first-class-citizens
//? This means that functions are simply values
//? Functions are just another type of object since objects are just values functions are values too.
// * With the all above enables us to:
//? Store functions in variable or properties (Function Expression and Methods)
//? Pass functions as arguments to other functions (Function that goes into the Event Listener)
//? Return functions from functions
//? Call methods on functions (Since functions are simply objects and many types of objects have methods so the functions ex: bind)

//!  -------------- HIGH ORDER FUNCTIONS -----------
//? A functon that receives another function as an argument,return a new function or both.
//? This is possible because of the first-class functions.
// * Function can receive another function (Event Listener takes other function as an input)
//!!! Function that is passed in is a Callback function.
// * Function that returns new function

//! First Class Function VS High Order Function
//? First class function is just a feature that a programming language have or does not have. All it means all functions are values. There is no first class functions in practice.
//? But there are high order functions because of the language supports first class functions.
